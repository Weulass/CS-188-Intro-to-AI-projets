# CS-188-projets
Introduction to AI

Ideas and techniques underlying the design of intelligent computer systems. Topics include search, game playing, knowledge representation, inference, planning, reasoning under uncertainty, machine learning, robotics, perception, and language understanding


## Project 1

Implemented Depth First Search, Breadth First Search, Uniform Cost Search, and A* Search. Created different heuristics. Helped pacman agent find shortest path to eat all dots.

## Project 2

Created basic reflex agent based on a variety of parameters. Improved agent to use minimax algorithm (with alpha-beta pruning). Implemented expectimax for random ghost agents. Improved evaluation function for pacman states.
